The shared dependencies between the files we are generating are:

1. **Next.js**: This is the main framework used for building the application. It is used in all the files for server-side rendering and routing.

2. **React**: Next.js is built on top of React, so React components and hooks are used throughout the application.

3. **TypeScript**: TypeScript is used in all the .tsx files for type checking and improved developer experience.

4. **React-DOM**: This is used in _document.tsx for rendering the application on the server side.

5. **CSS Modules**: CSS Modules are used in the .css files for styling the components.

6. **Common Components**: The Header.tsx and Footer.tsx components are likely used in multiple pages of the application.

7. **Global Styles**: The globals.css file is likely imported in _app.tsx to apply global styles to the application.

8. **Public Assets**: The favicon.ico and vercel.svg files in the public directory are likely used in multiple places in the application, such as in the Header component or in the HTML head in _document.tsx.

9. **Package.json**: This file contains the list of all the dependencies used in the application, which are shared across all the files.

10. **tsconfig.json**: This file contains the TypeScript configuration used in all the .tsx files.

11. **.next/config.js**: This file contains the Next.js configuration used in all the files.

Please note that without the actual code, it's hard to provide the exact names of exported variables, data schemas, id names of DOM elements, message names, and function names.
